# Rollup

It's a module bundler, like Webpack. These tools are not compilers, but more like archivers. They, in simple terms, concatenate all sources, assets, etc. into a bundle.

# Importing CSS

You can apparently import css files in react component files. This was very interesting and new to me. Long story short, Vite uses a plugin vite:css (stock), which by default uses postcss, which is setup manually to use Tailwind CSS.

# TODOs

* Learn more about the module bundler tools.
* Look into [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss)
